### Note:

To run this code, you'll have to have a version of the timbretoolbox in this directory, which I have not uploaded. You'll also have to use my script, `pyTimbre.m` to interface with the Matlab-Python engine.

The timbre toolbox can be found at [this github repository](https://github.com/mondaugen/timbretoolbox).
